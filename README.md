# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express back-end skills.

# Features

# Tech Stack
Frontend
HTML & CSS

Built with semantic HTML5 for improved accessibility and readability.

Responsive layout using Flexbox for cross-device compatibility.

Styled using SCSS with external fonts: Source Sans Pro and Bungee for a clean, modern look.

JavaScript & jQuery

Utilizes jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling.

Dynamically renders tweets without reloading the page.

Includes live character counter and form validation for user input.

AJAX

Fetches tweets asynchronously from the server.
